# Testing for Equality in High-dimensional Covariance Matrices

```Testing-for-equality-in-high-dimensional-covariance-matrices``` is a repo wich provides a discussion on how to test for equality between covaraince matrices from different sub-populations in high-dimensional settings, making use of recent advances in Random Matrix Theory and Central Limit Theorems.  

## Summary

We will be looking into this notebook.
