# Testing for Equality in High-dimensional Covariance Matrices

## Summary

```Testing-for-equality-in-high-dimensional-covariance-matrices``` is a repo that provides a discussion on how to test for equality between covariance matrices from different sub-populations in high-dimensional settings by making use of recent advances in Random Matrix Theory and Central Limit Theorems. The repo also contains demos on how to implement such, relatively new, methodologies in ```R```.

More specifically, we will be looking into [this notebook](https://github.com/smarinardila/Testing-for-equality-in-high-dimensional-covariance-matrices/blob/main/testing_equality_covariance_matrices.ipynb).
